# Evolution algorithm
A small, quick project i did for fun. 

Population consists of individuals (arrays) filled with ""bytes"". Algorithm rewards indivs with more ones. I may do sth more useful with it some day. 

Messy codebase warning, because i've mostly written the algorithm from memory.

Min python versions: 2.6, 3.0
