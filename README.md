# Evolution algorithm
A small, quick project i did for fun. 

Population consists of individuals (arrays) filled with ""bytes"". Algorithm rewards indivs with more ones. I may do sth more useful with it some day. 

Messy codebase warning, because i mostly written the algorithm from memory.

Requires python 3.10. Probably way lower, but will check later.

Config wiki soon.

### Setup

1. Clone this repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Macck209/evo-alg
2. Experiment with config
3. Run the script
   ```bash
   py evo_simulator.py
